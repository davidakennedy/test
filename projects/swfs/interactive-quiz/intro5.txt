myVariable=<p>When faced with a difficult decision that you might be struggling with, use this simple technique. Ask yourself, Ethics, Please?

Please stands for:

P = Policies (Is it consistent with my organization’s policies and procedures?)
L = Legal (Is it acceptable under the applicable laws and regulations?)
E = Ethical (What is the right thing to do?)
A = Action (Do my actions support my organization’s values?)
S = Self (What will happen to me as a consequence of my actions?)
E = Empathy (Do my actions consider the thoughts and needs of others?)
</p>
