myVariable=<p><b>Massage Therapy</b>: You are an instructor at GTCC working in the massage therapy department on a part-time basis.  You also own an aromatherapy business and some of your students request your products occasionally.  So you sell products to students during the workday.  You usually give them a small discount, plus you save a lot on gas money.

Was your decision to sell products during the workday an ethical one and why?

A.	Yes, because Iâ€™m not harming the college in any way.
B.	No, because I am creating a conflict of interest between professional duties at the college and my business. Plus, I could potentially favor students who buy my products.
C.	Yes, because I am exposing students not only on the proper techniques and products in massage therapy, but also how to run a small business.
D.	No, because my students enjoy having a chance to buy my products before, during and after class.
