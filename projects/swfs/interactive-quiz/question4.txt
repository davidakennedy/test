myVariable=<p><b>A Little Vacation</b>: You plan events for GTCC, and frequently negotiate with hotels, restaurants and travel agencies.  One hotel recently offered you a free weekend stay for your entire family.  This would make for a nice vacation.  I agreed, but I had the hotel staff place the reservation in my husband’s name.

Do you think your actions raise questions about the employee’s ethical philosophy?

A. Yes, after evaluating the decision you realize that you’ve accepted a gift from a vendor associated with the college, which is against college policy. You decide to inform your manager immediately of your mistake.
B. No, taking a weekend stay is not a big deal because it’s just a few days.
C. Yes, only because you should have made the reservation in your name.
D. No, after you evaluated you decision, you determined it was the proper one.</p>
