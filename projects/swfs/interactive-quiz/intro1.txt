Welcome to Survivor: Ethics Island, where the faculty and staff at Guilford Technical Community College go to win $1 Million for surviving this small, non-descript island in the middle of the Pacific. Ok, so we don’t have $1 million for you, but you do need to survive. And to do that, you must know how to handle a few ethical dilemmas. 

Answer questions right and you’ll get closer to escaping Ethics Island. However, miss too many, and you’ll wash back up on shore in no time.

Be sure to explore the island for additional information about ethics in the workplace or click the Help button for a hint to the answer.
